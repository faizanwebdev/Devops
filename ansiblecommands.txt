Ansible Installation(Installatio to be done on ansible server machine only and not on host machine)

yum install wget -y #install wget package if it not there
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm #download epel package repository from internet
yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y #install the epel package
yum update -y #update the OS for updating the packages and dependency files
yum install git python python-pip python-devel openssl ansible -y #install these packages(ansible is main package and rest all other are dependency package for ansible as ansible is developed using python)

Open the ansible.cfg file and uncomment inventory line and sudo user line and save the file
Open the hosts file and add the host machines IP address or create the group and add host machines IP addresses

#Linux Administration commands

useradd <username> #command to add new user. NOTE: for ansible operations, the username of ansible server machine and ansible host machine should be same
passwd <username> #to set password of the specific user

#give root user privileges to ansible user on ansible server machine as well as on ansible host machine
for giving root user privileges, linux system have sudoers files in which multiple user can work on that single file at onetime which can create a huge conflict
so redhat company has created a new file called as visudo file for resolving this problem as only one user can work on this file at a time

#open visudo file and add the ansible user inside it and give all root user privileges
<ansible username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
